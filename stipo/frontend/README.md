React part of the project was created using **create-react-app**.
For local development, in package.json, added a proxy to Django Server.

Modules used:

 - **axios** - for API requests.
 - **react-router-dom** - for Routing
 - **query-string** - to parse the URL (used to get variables from GET request)

For tests, installed **enzyme**.
